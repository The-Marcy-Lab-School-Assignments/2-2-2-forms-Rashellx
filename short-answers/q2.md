# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
We need labels for every input because they are important if we get an error it would be clear where it is at. Also 
they make it clear what information we need to input when we use them. Two ways to pair an input with a label. 
* Wrapping an input inside the label `label` element
* Using a `for` attribute
