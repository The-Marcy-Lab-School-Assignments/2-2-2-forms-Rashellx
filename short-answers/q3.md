# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer
Default behavior:
```html
<button></button>
```
The default behavior of the code above is it will behave like a submit button if placed inside a form. Since there is no `type` attribute it defaults to a `type="submit"`.

```html
<button type="submit"></button>
```
The code above has the `type="submit"` attribute. So the default behavior of this would be it behave like a submit button.

```html
<button type="reset"></button>
```
The default behavior here would be resetting the form.

```html
<button type="button"></button>
```
This default behavior is it behaves like a normal button.
